### EDA on Weather data set.
In This Notebook we delve deeper into our week one weather dataset and perform EDA to answer the following questions;
------
#### Data Overview and Cleaning:
- What are the key characteristics of the dataset? (e.g., number of records, features, data types)
- Identify and handle any missing or null values. 
- Check for and address any duplicate records.
------------
#### Statistical Summary:
- Provide a statistical summary of the dataset (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical features.
- Identify and describe any significant outliers in the data.
--------------
#### Data Visualization:
- Create visualizations to show the distribution of key weather parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).
- Plot time series graphs to visualize trends over time. Highlight any notable patterns or seasonal variations.
- Create correlation matrices and heatmaps to identify relationships between different weather parameters.
-------------
#### Weather Patterns and Trends:
- Analyze and describe any trends or patterns you observe in the data.
- Investigate any anomalies or unusual patterns in the data. What might be the reasons for these anomalies?
--------------
#### Insights and Conclusions:
- Summarize the key insights you have gained from your EDA. What are the most interesting or surprising findings?
- How can these insights be useful for weather prediction or other practical applications?
#### Recommendations for Further Analysis:
- Suggest areas for further analysis or additional data that might be useful to explore.

All responses, explanations and visualizations are contained in the Weather EDA notebook.
